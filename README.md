# AllowanceCalculator
An Android Application that helps you manage your money.

The problem that I had is:
I have X amount of money that should cover me for Y amount of days.

what I do is that I divide X by Y to give myself an allowance... and I keep track of everything I spend or receive using notes on my cell phone.

This app was created just to automate this process.
I tell it the X amount of money that I have.
I tell it the Y days that should be covered.
it tells me my allowance.
whenever I spend money I tell the app.
whenever I receive money I tell the app.
whenever I spend more that I should, the app recalculates X/Y which makes my allowance less.

that's it.
